## Overview
The Dashboard Job Seeker project is a comprehensive web application tailored specifically for job seekers, aiming to streamline and enhance their job search experience. In today's dynamic job market, job seekers often encounter challenges in managing job applications, tracking their progress, and staying organized throughout the employment-seeking journey. This project addresses these pain points by providing a centralized dashboard equipped with robust features and functionalities.

## Purpose

As someone who understands the frustrations and demands of job hunting firsthand, I embarked on this endeavor to create a solution that not only addresses common pain points but also elevates the job-seeking experience to new heights. By developing the Dashboard Job Seeker, I aspire to offer a comprehensive platform that serves as a one-stop destination for job seekers to manage their applications efficiently, gain insights into their job search progress, and ultimately achieve their career goals with confidence.
